Its value to replace X-ray and computed tomography (CT) when radiation exposure or iodinated contrast material is contra-indicated is well acknowledged: i.e. for paediatric patients and pregnant women or for scientific use. One of the reasons why MRI of the lung is still rarely used, except in a few centres, is the lack of consistent protocols customised to clinical needs. This article makes non-vendor-specific protocol suggestions for general use with state-of-the-art MRI scanners, based on the available literature and a consensus discussion within a panel of experts experienced in lung MRI. Various sequences have been successfully tested within scientific or clinical environments. MRI of the lung with appropriate combinations of these sequences comprises morphological and functional imaging aspects in a single examination. It serves in difficult clinical problems encountered in daily routine, such as assessment of the mediastinum and chest wall, and even might challenge molecular imaging techniques in the near future. This article helps new users to implement appropriate protocols on their own MRI platforms. Main Messages • MRI of the lung can be readily performed on state-of-the-art 1.5-T MRI scanners. • Protocol suggestions based on the available literature facilitate its use for routine • MRI offers solutions for complicated thoracic masses with atelectasis and chest wall invasion. • MRI is an option for paediatrics and science when CT is contra-indicated},

Proprietary formats and closed single-vendor platforms prevail but depend on the availability and maintenance of multiformat conversion libraries. Expedient for small deployments, this is not sustainable at an industrial scale. Primarily known as a standard for radiology, the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard has been evolving to support other specialties since its inception, to become the single ubiquitous standard throughout medical imaging. The adoption of DICOM for whole slide imaging (WSI) has been sluggish. Prospects for widespread commercially viable clinical use of digital pathology change the incentives. Connectathons using DICOM have demonstrated its feasibility for WSI and virtual microscopy. Adoption of DICOM for digital and computational pathology will allow the reuse of enterprise-wide infrastructure for storage, security, and business continuity. The DICOM embedded metadata allows detached files to remain useful. Bright-field and multichannel fluorescence, Z-stacks, cytology, and sparse and fully tiled encoding are supported. External terminologies and standard compression schemes are supported. Color consistency is defined using International Color Consortium profiles. The DICOM files can be dual personality Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) for legacy support. Annotations for computational pathology results can be encoded.},

  abstract = {4 dimensional (4D) medical imaging symbolizes the next step in imaging. This advanced imaging method makes image analysis much faster and more accurate than ever. 4D medical imaging is the technique that combines three-dimensional (3D) images with time such that the movement and variation can be observed and analyzed in a more accurate way. 4D medical imaging includes time-resolved volumetric computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, and ultrasound imaging. This chapter aims at presenting the current improvements in 4D medical imaging and diagnosis. The main challenge in the 3D medical imaging is the motion artifacts produced due to voluntary or involuntary patient motion such as digestive, cardiac, respiratory, and muscular motion. These artifacts can be efficiently handled by 4D image analysis. A large number of research papers are about different modalities of medical imaging and 3D scanning to identify the impact of them but very few literature on 4D imaging and diagnosis. The main objective of this chapter is to find the best possible usage of 4D imaging and its effective diagnosis. This will enable the physicians and researchers to identify the best treatment for the patients by minimizing the risks and to maximize accuracy and safety. A number of literature was studied systematically to analyze the challenges, limitations, and future directions. The observation shows that there is an increasing trend in research work in the field of 4D imaging. Different 4D imaging modalities, applications, techniques, and methods used in routine imaging and diagnosis were also discussed in detail. Machine learning is the part of artificial intelligence that provides solutions to the various medical imaging applications such as computer-aided diagnosis, lesion segmentation, medical image analysis, image-guided therapy, annotation and retrieval with 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Hence various machine learning techniques used in medical imaging is also discussed. Finally, the limitations, challenges, and future direction of research were given for the benefit of the researchers.},

Methods A previous method was developed to generate on-board VC-MRI by deforming prior MRI images based on a MM and a single-slice on-board 2D-cine image. The two major improvements over the previous method are: (I) FD was introduced to estimate VC-MRI to correct for inaccuracies in the MM; (II) multi-slice undersampled 2D-cine images reconstructed by a k-t SLR reconstruction method were used for FD-based estimation to maintain the temporal resolution while improving the accuracy of VC-MRI. The method was evaluated using XCAT lung simulation and four liver patients’ data. Results For XCAT, VC-MRI estimated using ten undersampled sagittal 2D-cine MRIs resulted in volume percent difference/volume dice coefficient/center-of-mass shift of 9.77\%±3.71\%/0.95±0.02/0.75±0.26 mm among all scenarios based on estimation with MM and FD. Adding FD optimization improved VC-MRI accuracy substantially for scenarios with anatomical changes. For patient data, the mean tumor tracking errors were 0.64±0.51, 0.62±0.47 and 0.24±0.24 mm along the superior-inferior (SI), anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral directions, respectively, across all liver patients. Conclusions It is feasible to improve VC-MRI accuracy while maintaining high temporal resolution using FD and multi-slice undersampled 2D cine images for real-time 3D target verification.},

However, there are always cases where automatic algorithms fail to provide an acceptable segmentation. In these cases the user needs efficient segmentation editing tools, a problem which has not received much attention in research. We give a comprehensive overview on segmentation editing for three-dimensional (3D) medical images. For segmentation editing in two-dimensional (2D) images, we discuss a sketch-based approach where the user modifies the segmentation in the contour domain. Based on this 2D interface, we present an image-based as well as an image-independent method for intuitive and efficient segmentation editing in 3D in the context of tumour segmentation in computed tomography (CT). Our editing tools have been evaluated on a database containing 1226 representative liver metastases, lung nodules and lymph nodes of different shape, size and image quality. In addition, we have performed a qualitative evaluation with radiologists and technical experts, proving the efficiency of our tools.},

  abstract = {Image-guided diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are related to, or performed under, some kind of imaging. Such imaging may be direct inspection (as in open surgery) or indirect inspection as in endoscopy or laparoscopy. Common to all these techniques is the transformation of optical and visible information to a monitor or the eye of the operator. Image-guided therapy (IGT) differs by using processed imaging data acquired before, during and after a wide range of different imaging techniques. This means that the planning, performing and monitoring, as well as the control of the therapeutic procedure, are based and dependent on the “virtual reality” provided by imaging investigations. Since most of such imaging involves radiology in the broadest sense, there is a need to characterise IGT in more detail. In this paper, the technical, medico-legal and medico-political issues will be discussed. The focus will be put on state-of-the-art imaging, technical developments, methodological and legal requisites concerning radiation protection and licensing, speciality-specific limitations and crossing specialty borders, definition of technical and quality standards, and finally to the issue of awareness of IGT within the medical and public community. The specialty-specific knowledge should confer radiologists with a significant role in the overall responsibility for the imaging-related processes in various non-radiological specialties. These processes may encompass purchase, servicing, quality management, radiation protection and documentation, also taking responsibility for the definition and compliance with the legal requirements regarding all radiological imaging performed by non-radiologists.},

  abstract = {Purpose To reduce cardiotoxicity from breast radiotherapy (RT), innovative techniques are under investigation. Information about cardiac motion with respiration and positional reproducibility under active breathing control (ABC) is necessary to evaluate these techniques. Methods Patients requiring loco-regional RT for breast cancer were CT-scanned using an ABC device at various breath-hold states, before and during treatment. Ten patients were studied. For each patient, 12 datasets were analyzed. Mutual information-based regional rigid alignment was used to determine the magnitude and reproducibility of cardiac motion as a function of breathing state. For each scan session, motion was quantified by evaluating the displacement of a point along the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with respect to its position at end expiration. Long-term positional reproducibility was also assessed. Results Displacement of the LAD was greatest in the inferior direction, moderate in the anterior direction, and lowest in the left-right direction. At shallow breathing states, the average displacement of LAD position was up to 6mm in the inferior direction. The maximum displacement in any patient was 2.8cm in the inferior direction, between expiration and deep-inspiration breath hold (DIBH). At end expiration, the long-term reproducibility (SD) of the LAD position was 3mm in the A-P, 6mm in the S-I, and 4mm in the L-R directions. At DIBH, long-term reproducibility was 3mm in the A-P, 7mm in the S-I, and 3mm in the L-R directions. Conclusions These data demonstrate the extent of LAD displacement that occurs with shallow breathing and with DIBH. This information may guide optimization studies considering the effects of respiratory motion and reproducibility of cardiac position on cardiac dose, both with and without ABC.},

  abstract = {Capturing an enclosing volume of moving subjects and organs using fast individual image slice acquisition has shown promise in dealing with motion artefacts. Motion between slice acquisitions results in spatial inconsistencies that can be resolved by slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods to provide high quality 3D image data. Existing algorithms are, however, typically very slow, specialised to specific applications and rely on approximations, which impedes their potential clinical use. In this paper, we present a fast multi-GPU accelerated framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. It is based on optimised 2D/3D registration, super-resolution with automatic outlier rejection and an additional (optional) intensity bias correction. We introduce a novel and fully automatic procedure for selecting the image stack with least motion to serve as an initial registration target. We evaluate the proposed method using artificial motion corrupted phantom data as well as clinical data, including tracked freehand ultrasound of the liver and fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We achieve speed-up factors greater than 30 compared to a single CPU system and greater than 10 compared to currently available state-of-the-art multi-core CPU methods. We ensure high reconstruction accuracy by exact computation of the pointspread function for every input data point, which has not previously been possible due to computational limitations. Our framework and its implementation is scalable for available computational infrastructures and tests show a speed-up factor of 1.70 for each additional GPU. This paves the way for the online application of image based reconstruction methods during clinical examinations. The source code for the proposed approach is publicly available.},

Materials and Methods One hundred normal subjects (50 men, mean age 44.6 years) underwent carotid vessel wall MR using 2D and 3D techniques. Carotid artery total vessel volume, lumen volume, wall volume, and wall/outer wall (W/OW) ratio were measured over 20 contiguous slices. Two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) results were compared. Results The mean difference between 2D and 3D datasets (as a percentage of the mean absolute value) was 1.7\% for vessel volume, 4.9\% for lumen volume, 4.7\% for wall volume, and 5.8\% for W/OW ratio. There was good correlation between 2D and 3D models for total vessel volume (R2 = 0.93, P {$<$} 0.001), lumen area (R2 = 0.92, P {$<$} 0.001), and wall volume (R2 = 0.77, P {$<$} 0.001). The correlation for the W/OW ratio was weaker (R2 = 0.30; P {$<$} 0.001). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the 3D technique was 2.1-fold greater than for the 2D technique (P {$<$} 0.001). When using the 3D sequence, scan time was reduced by 63\%. Conclusion Multislab volume selective 3D FSE carotid arterial wall imaging performs similarly to a conventional 2D technique, but with over twice the SNR and substantially reduced scan time. J. Magn.

  abstract = {Purpose Real-time high soft-tissue contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from the MR-Linac offers the best opportunity for accurate motion tracking during radiation therapy delivery via high-frequency two-dimensional (2D) cine imaging. This work investigates the efficacy of real-time organ motion tracking based on the registration of MRI acquired on MR-Linac. Methods Algorithms based on image intensity were developed to determine the three-dimensional (3D) translation of abdominal targets. 2D and 3D abdominal MRIs were acquired for 10 healthy volunteers using a high-field MR-Linac. For each volunteer, 3D respiration-gated T2 and 2D T2/T1-weighted cine in sagittal, coronal, and axial planes with a planar temporal resolution of 0.6 for 60 s was captured. Datasets were also collected on MR-compatible physical and virtual four-dimensional (4D) motion phantoms. Target contours for the liver and pancreas from the 3D T2 were populated to the cine and assumed as the ground-truth motion. We performed image registration using a research software to track the target 3D motion. Standard deviations of the error (SDE) between the ground-truth and tracking were analyzed. Results Algorithms using a research software were demonstrated to be capable of tracking arbitrary targets in the abdomen at 5 Hz with an overall accuracy of 0.6 mm in phantom studies and 2.1 mm in volunteers. However, this value is subject to patient-specific considerations, namely motion amplitude. Calculation times of {$<$} 50 ms provide a pathway of real-time motion tracking integration. A major challenge in using 2D cine MRI to track the target is handling the full 3D motion of the target. Conclusions Feasibility to track organ motion using intensity-based registration of MRIs was demonstrated for abdominal targets. Tracking accuracy of about 2 mm was achieved for the motion of the liver and pancreatic head for typical patient motion. Further development is ongoing to improve the tracking algorithm for large and complex motions.},

  abstract = {We have developed a method to determine intrafraction motion of the prostate through automatic fiducial marker (FM) tracking on 3D cine-magnetic resonance (MR) images with high spatial and temporal resolution. Twenty-nine patients undergoing prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), with four implanted cylindrical gold FMs, had cine-MR imaging sessions after each of five weekly fractions. Each cine-MR examination consisted of 55 sequentially obtained 3D datasets (‘dynamics’), acquired over a 11 s period, covering a total of 10 min. FM locations in the first dynamic were manually identified by a clinician, FM centers in subsequent dynamics were automatically determined. Center of mass (COM) translations and rotations were determined by calculating the rigid transformations between the FM template of the first and subsequent dynamics. The algorithm was applied to 7315 dynamics over 133 scans of 29 patients and the obtained results were validated by comparing the COM locations recorded by the clinician at the halfway-dynamic (after 5 min) and end dynamic (after 10 min). The mean COM translations at 10 min were X: 0.0 0.8 mm, Y: 1.0 1.9 mm and Z: 0.9 2.0 mm. The mean rotation results at 10 min were X: 0.1 3.9°, Y: 0.0 1.3° and Z: 0.1 1.2°. The tracking success rate was 97.7\% with a mean 3D COM error of 1.1 mm. We have developed a robust, fast and accurate FM tracking algorithm for cine-MR data, which allows for continuous monitoring of prostate motion during MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT). These results will be used to validate automatic prostate tracking based on soft-tissue contrast.},

In order to take advantage of the system’s capabilities and enable online adaptive treatments, a new generation of software should be developed, ranging from motion estimation to treatment plan adaptation. In this work we present a proof of principle adaptive pipeline designed for high precision stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) suitable for sites affected by respiratory motion, like renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We utilized our research MRL treatment planning system (MRLTP) to simulate a single fraction 25 Gy free-breathing SBRT treatment for RCC by performing inter-beam replanning for two patients and one volunteer. The simulated pipeline included a combination of (pre-beam) 4D-MRI and (online) 2D cine-MR acquisitions. The 4DMRI was used to generate the mid-position reference volume, while the cine-MRI, via an in-house motion model, provided three-dimensional (3D) deformable vector fields (DVFs) describing the anatomical changes during treatment. During the treatment fraction, at an inter-beam interval, the mid-position volume of the patient was updated and the delivered dose was accurately reconstructed on the underlying motion calculated by the model. Fast online replanning, targeting the latest anatomy and incorporating the previously delivered dose was then simulated with MRLTP. The adaptive treatment was compared to a conventional mid-position SBRT plan with a 3 mm planning target volume margin reconstructed on the same motion trace. We demonstrate that our system produced tighter dose distributions and thus spared the healthy tissue, while delivering more dose to the target. The pipeline was able to account for baseline variations/drifts that occurred during treatment ensuring target coverage at the end of the treatment fraction.},

Especially, it is difficult for surgeons to detect and accurately remove metastatic tumors by predominantly using visual examination and palpation owing to the lack of effective means to specifically distinguish the boundary range between normal and tumor tissues. Thus, the development of activated fluorescent probe with superior tumor-to-normal (T/N) tissue ratios is particularly urgent in clinics. In view of CD13/aminopeptidase N (APN) regarded as a cancer-specific biomarker, mediating with progression, invasion, and migration of malignant tumor, herein, we reported an APN-responsive fluorescent probe YH-APN and demonstrated its application to distinguish cancer cells. Through in situ spraying manner, fluorescent superior tumor-to-normal (T/N) tissue ratios (subcutaneous transplantation tumor, 13.86; hepatic metastasis, 4.42 and 6.25; splenic metastasis, 4.99) were achieved. More importantly, we have demonstrated the ability to image metastasis tumor tissue less than 1 mm in diameter, highlighting the potential for this probe to be used as a tool in surgical resection. This research may spur the use of enzyme-activatable fluorescent probes for the progress of tumor diagnosis and image-guided surgery (IGS).},

  abstract = {Existing automatic 3D image segmentation methods usually fail to meet the clinic use. Many studies have explored an interactive strategy to improve the image segmentation performance by iteratively incorporating user hints. However, the dynamic process for successive interactions is largely ignored. We here propose to model the dynamic process of iterative interactive image segmentation as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it with reinforcement learning (RL). Unfortunately, it is intractable to use single-agent RL for voxel-wise prediction due to the large exploration space. To reduce the exploration space to a tractable size, we treat each voxel as an agent with a shared voxel-level behavior strategy so that it can be solved with multi-agent reinforcement learning. An additional advantage of this multi-agent model is to capture the dependency among voxels for segmentation task. Meanwhile, to enrich the information of previous segmentations, we reserve the prediction uncertainty in the state space of MDP and derive an adjustment action space leading to a more precise and finer segmentation. In addition, to improve the efficiency of exploration, we design a relative cross-entropy gain-based reward to update the policy in a constrained direction. Experimental results on various medical datasets have shown that our method significantly outperforms existing state-ofthe-art methods, with the advantage of fewer interactions and a faster convergence.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Intrafraction motion can result in a smearing of planned external beam radiation therapy dose distributions, resulting in an uncertainty in dose actually deposited in tissue. The purpose of this paper is to present a pulse sequence that is capable of imaging a moving target at a high frame rate in two orthogonal planes simultaneously for MR-guided radiotherapy. THEORY: By balancing the zero gradient moment on all axes, slices in two orthogonal planes may be spatially encoded simultaneously. The orthogonal slice groups may be acquired with equal or nonequal echo times. METHODS: A Cartesian spoiled gradient echo simultaneous orthogonal plane imaging (SOPI) sequence was tested in phantom and in vivo. Multiplexed SOPI acquisitions were performed in which two parallel slices were imaged along two orthogonal axes simultaneously. An autocalibrating phase-constrained 2D-SENSE-GRAPPA (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition) algorithm was implemented to reconstruct the multiplexed data.

  abstract = {Purpose Intrafraction motion can result in a smearing of planned external beam radiation therapy dose distributions, resulting in an uncertainty in dose actually deposited in tissue. The purpose of this paper is to present a pulse sequence that is capable of imaging a moving target at a high frame rate in two orthogonal planes simultaneously for MR-guided radiotherapy. Theory By balancing the zero gradient moment on all axes, slices in two orthogonal planes may be spatially encoded simultaneously. The orthogonal slice groups may be acquired with equal or nonequal echo times. Methods A Cartesian spoiled gradient echo simultaneous orthogonal plane imaging (SOPI) sequence was tested in phantom and in vivo. Multiplexed SOPI acquisitions were performed in which two parallel slices were imaged along two orthogonal axes simultaneously. An autocalibrating phase-constrained 2D-SENSE-GRAPPA (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition) algorithm was implemented to reconstruct the multiplexed data. Results SOPI images without intraslice motion artifacts were reconstructed at a maximum frame rate of 8.16 Hz. The 2D-SENSE-GRAPPA reconstruction separated the parallel slices aliased along each orthogonal axis. Conclusion The high spatiotemporal resolution provided by SOPI has the potential to be beneficial for intrafraction motion management during MR-guided radiation therapy or other MRI-guided interventions.

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an important tool for the clinical evaluation of patients with cardiovascular disease. Since its introduction in the late 1980s, 2-dimensional phase contrast MRI (2D PC-MRI) has become a routine part of standard-of-care cardiac MRI for the assessment of regional blood flow in the heart and great vessels. More recently, time-resolved PC-MRI with velocity encoding along all three flow directions and three-dimensional (3D) anatomic coverage (also termed ‘4D flow MRI’) has been developed and applied for the evaluation of cardiovascular hemodynamics in multiple regions of the human body. 4D flow MRI allows for the comprehensive evaluation of complex blood flow patterns by 3D blood flow visualization and flexible retrospective quantification of flow parameters. Recent technical developments, including the utilization of advanced parallel imaging techniques such as k-t GRAPPA, have resulted in reasonable overall scan times, e.g., 8-12 minutes for 4D flow MRI of the aorta and 10-20 minutes for whole heart coverage. As a result, the application of 4D flow MRI in a clinical setting has become more feasible, as documented by an increased number of recent reports on the utility of the technique for the assessment of cardiac and vascular hemodynamics in patient studies. A number of studies have demonstrated the potential of 4D flow MRI to provide an improved assessment of hemodynamics which might aid in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this review is to describe the methods used for 4D flow MRI acquisition, post-processing and data analysis. In addition, the article provides an overview of the clinical applications of 4D flow MRI and includes a review of applications in the heart, thoracic aorta and hepatic system.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that is becoming more and more important in clinical cardiology. Physicians must understand the basic principles of MRI before reliable use in practice is possible. Therefore, we will give an introduction to basic MRI principles necessary to understand the difficulties of cardiac MRI. First the generation of a signal by the combination of a strong magnetic field, radiofrequency pulses, and temporary changes in the magnetic field is explained. Then, the processes of localization of different points in an image, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio are highlighted. Finally, the influence of tissue characteristics such as T1 and T2 on the contrast of an image are discussed. Copyright © 1999 by W.B.

  abstract = {All modalities in radiology practice have become digital, and therefore deal with DICOM images. Image files that are compliant with part 10 of the DICOM standard are generally referred to as “DICOM format files” or simply “DICOM files” and are represented as “.dcm.” DICOM differs from other image formats in that it groups information into data sets. A DICOM file consists of a header and image data sets packed into a single file. The information within the header is organized as a constant and standardized series of tags. By extracting data from these tags one can access important information regarding the patient demographics, study parameters, etc. In the interest of patient confidentiality, all information that can be used to identify the patient should be removed before DICOM images are transmitted over a network for educational or other purposes. In addition to the DICOM format, the radiologist routinely encounters images of several file formats such as JPEG, TIFF, GIF, and PNG. Each format has its own unique advantages and disadvantages, which must be taken into consideration when images are archived, used in teaching files, or submitted for publication. Knowledge about these formats and their attributes, such as image resolution, image compression, and image metadata, helps the radiologist in optimizing the archival, organization, and display of images. This article aims to increase the awareness among radiologists regarding DICOM and other image file formats encountered in clinical practice. It also suggests several tips and tricks that can be used by the radiologist so that the digital potential of these images can be fully utilized for maximization of workflow in the radiology practice.},

  abstract = {Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Radiofrequency catheter ablation can be effective for the treatment of VT but it carries a high rate of recurrence often attributable to insufficient depth of penetration for reaching critical arrhythmogenic substrates. Stereotactic body radioablation (SBRT) is a commonly used technology developed for the non-invasive treatment of solid tumours. Recent evidence suggests that it can also be effective for the treatment of VT. It is a non-invasive procedure and it has the unique advantage of delivering ablative energy to any desired volume within the body to reach sites that are inaccessible with catheter ablation. This article summarises the pre-clinical studies that have formed the evidence base for SBRT in the heart, describes the clinical approaches for SBRT VT ablation and provides perspective on next steps for this new treatment modality.},
