One of the reasons why MRI of the lung is still rarely used, except in a few centres, is the lack of consistent protocols customised to clinical needs. This article makes non-vendor-specific protocol suggestions for general use with state-of-the-art MRI scanners, based on the available literature and a consensus discussion within a panel of experts experienced in lung MRI. Various sequences have been successfully tested within scientific or clinical environments. MRI of the lung with appropriate combinations of these sequences comprises morphological and functional imaging aspects in a single examination. It serves in difficult clinical problems encountered in daily routine, such as assessment of the mediastinum and chest wall, and even might challenge molecular imaging techniques in the near future. This article helps new users to implement appropriate protocols on their own MRI platforms. Main Messages • MRI of the lung can be readily performed on state-of-the-art 1.5-T MRI scanners. • Protocol suggestions based on the available literature facilitate its use for routine • MRI offers solutions for complicated thoracic masses with atelectasis and chest wall invasion. • MRI is an option for paediatrics and science when CT is contra-indicated},

  abstract = {As the use of digital techniques in toxicologic pathology expands, challenges of scalability and interoperability come to the fore. Proprietary formats and closed single-vendor platforms prevail but depend on the availability and maintenance of multiformat conversion libraries. Expedient for small deployments, this is not sustainable at an industrial scale. Primarily known as a standard for radiology, the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard has been evolving to support other specialties since its inception, to become the single ubiquitous standard throughout medical imaging. The adoption of DICOM for whole slide imaging (WSI) has been sluggish. Prospects for widespread commercially viable clinical use of digital pathology change the incentives. Connectathons using DICOM have demonstrated its feasibility for WSI and virtual microscopy. Adoption of DICOM for digital and computational pathology will allow the reuse of enterprise-wide infrastructure for storage, security, and business continuity. The DICOM embedded metadata allows detached files to remain useful. Bright-field and multichannel fluorescence, Z-stacks, cytology, and sparse and fully tiled encoding are supported. External terminologies and standard compression schemes are supported. Color consistency is defined using International Color Consortium profiles. The DICOM files can be dual personality Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) for legacy support. Annotations for computational pathology results can be encoded.},

  abstract = {4 dimensional (4D) medical imaging symbolizes the next step in imaging. This advanced imaging method makes image analysis much faster and more accurate than ever. 4D medical imaging is the technique that combines three-dimensional (3D) images with time such that the movement and variation can be observed and analyzed in a more accurate way. 4D medical imaging includes time-resolved volumetric computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, and ultrasound imaging. This chapter aims at presenting the current improvements in 4D medical imaging and diagnosis. The main challenge in the 3D medical imaging is the motion artifacts produced due to voluntary or involuntary patient motion such as digestive, cardiac, respiratory, and muscular motion. These artifacts can be efficiently handled by 4D image analysis. A large number of research papers are about different modalities of medical imaging and 3D scanning to identify the impact of them but very few literature on 4D imaging and diagnosis. The main objective of this chapter is to find the best possible usage of 4D imaging and its effective diagnosis. This will enable the physicians and researchers to identify the best treatment for the patients by minimizing the risks and to maximize accuracy and safety. A number of literature was studied systematically to analyze the challenges, limitations, and future directions. The observation shows that there is an increasing trend in research work in the field of 4D imaging. Different 4D imaging modalities, applications, techniques, and methods used in routine imaging and diagnosis were also discussed in detail. Machine learning is the part of artificial intelligence that provides solutions to the various medical imaging applications such as computer-aided diagnosis, lesion segmentation, medical image analysis, image-guided therapy, annotation and retrieval with 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Hence various machine learning techniques used in medical imaging is also discussed. Finally, the limitations, challenges, and future direction of research were given for the benefit of the researchers.},

However, there are always cases where automatic algorithms fail to provide an acceptable segmentation. In these cases the user needs efficient segmentation editing tools, a problem which has not received much attention in research. We give a comprehensive overview on segmentation editing for three-dimensional (3D) medical images. For segmentation editing in two-dimensional (2D) images, we discuss a sketch-based approach where the user modifies the segmentation in the contour domain. Based on this 2D interface, we present an image-based as well as an image-independent method for intuitive and efficient segmentation editing in 3D in the context of tumour segmentation in computed tomography (CT). Our editing tools have been evaluated on a database containing 1226 representative liver metastases, lung nodules and lymph nodes of different shape, size and image quality. In addition, we have performed a qualitative evaluation with radiologists and technical experts, proving the efficiency of our tools.},

  abstract = {Capturing an enclosing volume of moving subjects and organs using fast individual image slice acquisition has shown promise in dealing with motion artefacts. Motion between slice acquisitions results in spatial inconsistencies that can be resolved by slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods to provide high quality 3D image data. Existing algorithms are, however, typically very slow, specialised to specific applications and rely on approximations, which impedes their potential clinical use. In this paper, we present a fast multi-GPU accelerated framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. It is based on optimised 2D/3D registration, super-resolution with automatic outlier rejection and an additional (optional) intensity bias correction. We introduce a novel and fully automatic procedure for selecting the image stack with least motion to serve as an initial registration target. We evaluate the proposed method using artificial motion corrupted phantom data as well as clinical data, including tracked freehand ultrasound of the liver and fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We achieve speed-up factors greater than 30 compared to a single CPU system and greater than 10 compared to currently available state-of-the-art multi-core CPU methods. We ensure high reconstruction accuracy by exact computation of the pointspread function for every input data point, which has not previously been possible due to computational limitations. Our framework and its implementation is scalable for available computational infrastructures and tests show a speed-up factor of 1.70 for each additional GPU. This paves the way for the online application of image based reconstruction methods during clinical examinations. The source code for the proposed approach is publicly available.},

  abstract = {Purpose To compare a multislab three-dimensional volume-selective fast spin-echo (FSE) magnetic resonance (MR) sequence with a routine two-dimensional FSE sequence for quantification of carotid wall volume. Materials and Methods One hundred normal subjects (50 men, mean age 44.6 years) underwent carotid vessel wall MR using 2D and 3D techniques. Carotid artery total vessel volume, lumen volume, wall volume, and wall/outer wall (W/OW) ratio were measured over 20 contiguous slices. Two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) results were compared. Results The mean difference between 2D and 3D datasets (as a percentage of the mean absolute value) was 1.7\% for vessel volume, 4.9\% for lumen volume, 4.7\% for wall volume, and 5.8\% for W/OW ratio. There was good correlation between 2D and 3D models for total vessel volume (R2 = 0.93, P {$<$} 0.001), lumen area (R2 = 0.92, P {$<$} 0.001), and wall volume (R2 = 0.77, P {$<$} 0.001). The correlation for the W/OW ratio was weaker (R2 = 0.30; P {$<$} 0.001). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the 3D technique was 2.1-fold greater than for the 2D technique (P {$<$} 0.001). When using the 3D sequence, scan time was reduced by 63\%. Conclusion Multislab volume selective 3D FSE carotid arterial wall imaging performs similarly to a conventional 2D technique, but with over twice the SNR and substantially reduced scan time. J. Magn.

There is an urgent need to find better ways to collect, annotate, and reuse medical imaging data. Unique domain issues with medical image datasets require further study, development, and dissemination of best practices and standards, and a coordinated effort among medical imaging domain experts, medical imaging informaticists, government and industry data scientists, and interested commercial, academic, and government entities. High-level attributes of reusable medical image datasets suitable to train, test, validate, verify, and regulate ML products should be better described. NIH and other government agencies should promote and, where applicable, enforce, access to medical image datasets. We should improve communication among medical imaging domain experts, medical imaging informaticists, academic clinical and basic science researchers, government and industry data scientists, and interested commercial entities.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that is becoming more and more important in clinical cardiology. Physicians must understand the basic principles of MRI before reliable use in practice is possible. Therefore, we will give an introduction to basic MRI principles necessary to understand the difficulties of cardiac MRI. First the generation of a signal by the combination of a strong magnetic field, radiofrequency pulses, and temporary changes in the magnetic field is explained. Then, the processes of localization of different points in an image, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio are highlighted. Finally, the influence of tissue characteristics such as T1 and T2 on the contrast of an image are discussed. Copyright © 1999 by W.B.

  abstract = {All modalities in radiology practice have become digital, and therefore deal with DICOM images. Image files that are compliant with part 10 of the DICOM standard are generally referred to as “DICOM format files” or simply “DICOM files” and are represented as “.dcm.” DICOM differs from other image formats in that it groups information into data sets. A DICOM file consists of a header and image data sets packed into a single file. The information within the header is organized as a constant and standardized series of tags. By extracting data from these tags one can access important information regarding the patient demographics, study parameters, etc. In the interest of patient confidentiality, all information that can be used to identify the patient should be removed before DICOM images are transmitted over a network for educational or other purposes. In addition to the DICOM format, the radiologist routinely encounters images of several file formats such as JPEG, TIFF, GIF, and PNG. Each format has its own unique advantages and disadvantages, which must be taken into consideration when images are archived, used in teaching files, or submitted for publication. Knowledge about these formats and their attributes, such as image resolution, image compression, and image metadata, helps the radiologist in optimizing the archival, organization, and display of images. This article aims to increase the awareness among radiologists regarding DICOM and other image file formats encountered in clinical practice. It also suggests several tips and tricks that can be used by the radiologist so that the digital potential of these images can be fully utilized for maximization of workflow in the radiology practice.},
